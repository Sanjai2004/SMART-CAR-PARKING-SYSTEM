# SMART-CAR-PARKING-SYSTEM with Python and OpenCV

Welcome to the Smart Car Parking System project! This project utilizes Python and OpenCV to create an intelligent parking system that leverages sensors for efficient parking space management.

## Overview

The Smart Car Parking System is designed to optimize parking space utilization by employing sensors to monitor and manage available parking spots. This repository contains the source code and resources needed to implement the system.

## Features

- *Parking Spot Detection:* Utilizes computer vision techniques with OpenCV to detect and analyze available parking spaces.
- *Sensor Integration:* Integrates sensors for real-time monitoring of parking spot occupancy.
- *User Interface:* Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize parking availability and occupancy information.
- *Efficient Parking:* Optimizes parking space usage, reducing congestion and improving overallÂ efficiency.
